/**
 * Controller function to retrieve a single user by ID.
 *
 * This function handles the request to find a specific user in the database
 * based on the provided ID. It calls the appropriate service method and returns
 * the user data if found. If an error occurs or the record is not found, it is handled
 * appropriately using Boom.
 *
 * @param {Object} req - The request object, expected to contain the user ID in the params.
 * @param {Object} res - The response object to send the user data if found.
 * @param {Function} next - The next middleware function in the Express.js stack.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - Returns a JSON response with the user data or an error.
