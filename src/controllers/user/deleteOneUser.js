 * Controller function to delete a user.

 *
 * @param {Object} req - The request object containing the user ID.
 * @param {Object} res - The response object to send the outcome of the operation.
 * @param {Function} next - The next middleware function in the Express.js stack.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - Returns a JSON response with the operation result.
